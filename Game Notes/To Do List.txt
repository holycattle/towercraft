~~TODO LIST~~
** Done.
* In Progress.

==[TOWERS]==
**-Make Tower Base Classes

-Create a pathable tower (tower that does not obstruct path)
-Figure out best way to react to missile target = null
	-ie. When the target of the missile dies midflight.
	-Current: Explode after target dies.
	-Solution:
		-Retarget to another enemy.
			-What properties must the enemy satisfy? What if the next enemy is a million miles away?
		-Continue following current trajectory until it hits the ground then explode.
-Make them cost money.
-Prevent user from adding a tower when there is an entity there.
-Subtract life from the life bar when they enter the portal.

==[ENEMIES]==
**-Randomize enemy movement
**-Add different monster types

-Make Enemy Base Classes
-Make a test enemy Slime
-Use only one path and then enemies move based off of that
-Make them smaller
-Come up with an algorithm for determining spawn scheme
	-List GameObjects = (GameObject, Time)
		-Monster to Spawn (how do we choose which monster to spawn?)
		-Time Since last Spawn (how long do we wait till we spawn the next one?)
-When they are moving, they can collide with each other.
	-Is this okay?
	-Ex. Speedsters push slow moving ones.
-Clean up pathing to remove interpolation
	-Also including diagonals without corner towers.
		
==[GUI]==
**-Tower Chooser

==[GAMEPLAY]==
-Currency System

==[WAVE CONTROLLER]==
**-Add a way to detect whether or not all monsters have been killed

-Make the wave generation algorithm.

==[OTHER]==
**-Change to First Person perspective.
